# Task 01

DevOps-Projects-Master
Task: Implement a highly available and scalable microservices architecture.

Objective: Master advanced DevOps practices like auto-scaling, load balancing, and monitoring in a production-grade environment.

Steps:

Use AWS ECS or Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Set up AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) with auto-scaling for EC2 instances or Fargate tasks.
Integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments of microservices.
Implement monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Provision Infrastructure:

Use Terraform to create:
A VPC with subnets in multiple availability zones.
ECS clusters or Kubernetes clusters (EKS).
Load balancers and auto-scaling groups.
Deploy sample microservices to demonstrate scaling.
Use CloudWatch logs and alarms for monitoring.
Verification:

Test load balancing by accessing the application via the ALBâ€™s DNS name.
Simulate traffic and observe auto-scaling behavior.
Cleanup:

Destroy all resources using terraform destroy.
Archive and document the configurations for future use.
